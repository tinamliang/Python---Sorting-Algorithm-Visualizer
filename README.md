# Python---Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

After taking ICS4U, I became interested in sorting algorithms, so I created this project to help me in my understanding. 

### What you'll need to run the program:
   
   * Tkinter GUI

### DEMO

Here is a clip of the program sorting a random set of numbers using insertion sort:

Other sorts that are included in this project:

   - Selection Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Shell Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Merge Sort (coming up!)
   
### HOW IT WORKS

According to user inputted preferences such as the size of the array, and the min and max values, the program will randomize a set of values than display the steps a certain sorting algorithm takes to sort the array. If the user doesn't enter any values, there are defaulted values in place.
